    <h1>Thank You, Tejesh Sir</h1>
    <h2>A small page filled with big gratitude</h2>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            This page is not just a piece of code.  
            It is a collection of feelings, respect, and gratitude that I wanted to express in my own way.
        </p>

        <p>
            From the very first day at Concentrix, when I joined as a new team member, you made me feel comfortable,
            supported, and valued. Adjusting to a new workplace is never easy, but because of you,
            the journey felt smooth and positive.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                You trusted me even when I was new.  
                You allowed me leaves during Diwali.  
                You gave me half-days whenever I genuinely needed them.  
                You gave me leaves in December so I could visit my home.  
                You even allowed me to rest in the office when I was tired from travelling.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            These may seem like small things, but for me, they meant a lot.
            They showed your understanding, kindness, and the human side of leadership
            that is very rare to find.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your support was not just professional — it was personal and genuine.
            Because of you, I felt motivated, respected, and confident at work.
            You didn’t just manage a team; you took care of people.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a Computer Science graduate, this is my small creative way of saying thank you —
            using what I know best: coding — to express what words alone sometimes cannot.
        </p>

        <p>
            You are truly the <strong>best Team Leader</strong> I have worked with,
            and I will always remember and respect you for the person you are.
        </p>
